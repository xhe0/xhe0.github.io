<h1><strong>I wandered lonely as a cloud</strong></h1>
<h4>by <em>William Wordsworth</em></h4>
<p>I wandered lonely as a cloud<br>
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br><br><br>
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br><br><br><br>
A host, of golden daffodils;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<span>Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br>
Continuous as the stars that shine</span><br>
And twinkle on the milky way,<br></p>
<h5>Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>
They stretched in never-ending line<br>
Along the margin of a bay:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br><br><br><br>
The waves beside them danced, but they<br><br><br><br>
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;<br><br><br><br>
A poet could not be but gay,<br>
In such a jocund company!<br></h5>
<h6>I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:<br>
For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
They flash upon that inward eye<br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br></h6>
<h3>And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
And dances with the daffodils.</h3>
