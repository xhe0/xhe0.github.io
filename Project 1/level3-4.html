<h1>I wandered lonely as a cloud</h1>
<h4>by <em>William Wordsworth</em></h4>
<h2>I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,</h2>
<h3>When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;</h3>
<h2>Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</h2>
<h4>Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,</h4>
<h5>Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
They stretched in never-ending line<br>
Along the margin of a bay:</h5>
<h2>Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</h2>
<h3>The waves beside them danced, but they<br>
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;</h3>
<h4>A poet could not be but gay,
In such a jocund company!</h4>
<h6>I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:</h6>
<h5>For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,</h5>
<h3>They flash upon that inward eye<br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;</h3>
<h2>And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
And dances with the daffodils.</h2>
