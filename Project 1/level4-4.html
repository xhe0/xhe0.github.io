    <h1>I wandered lonely as a cloud</h1>
<h4>by <em>William Wordsworth</em></h4>
<div class="box1">I wandered lonely as a cloud<br>
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br>
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br>
A host, of golden daffodils;<br></div>
<div class="box2">Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br>
Continuous as the stars that shine<br>
And twinkle on the milky way,<br>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>
They stretched in never-ending line<br>
Along the margin of a bay:<br></div>
<div class="box3">Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br>
The waves beside them danced, but they<br>
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;<br>
A poet could not be but gay,<br></div>
<div class="box4">In such a jocund company!<br>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:<br>
For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
They flash upon that inward eye<br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br></div>
<h2>And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.</h2>
